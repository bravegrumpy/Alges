# kink_negotiations

An app to keep track of necessary negotiation information for kink scenes.

Everything within .\brainstorming is considered non-code, and will not be included in any kind of deployment. I created it as a space to put UML diagrams and brainstorming for content.

## Tools to be used

### diagramming software/filetype

- use [Drawio](https://app.diagrams.net) as the software for diagramming.

  - UML diagrams will likely be useful once we have a bigger thing started.

## changelog

### 2023_04_02

- adding in brainstorming folder.
- asserting [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) as diagramming software
