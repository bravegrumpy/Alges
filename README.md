# kink_negotiations

An app to keep track of necessary negotiation information for kink scenes.

Everything within `.\brainstorming` is considered non-code, and will not be included in any kind of deployment. I created it as a space to put UML diagrams and brainstorming for content.

## App name

> - This speaks to the mission of facilitating negotions for kink scenes, that often involve voluntary pain, but must be practiced in a risk-aware and consensual manner. (Risk Aware Consentual Kink)

#### ~~alges~~

- ~~domain unavailable~~

## Tools to be used
